# Create your Phrase class logic here.

```
Create the Phrase class in the phrase.py file
The class should include an initializer or def __init__ that receives a phrase parameter and holds this phrase in an instance attribute on the Phrase object. A phrase should be a collection of Character objects, where each letter of the phrase is a Character() instance stored inside a collection such as a List.
Any additional instance attributes you feel you need to store are up to you.
The Phrase instance might be responsible for things like: Knowing if the entire phrase has been guessed, Iterating over its collection of Character to allow a guess to be checked using a Character instance method call or to ask the Character object how it should show its letter.
The instance method names and their implementation are up to you to determine.
